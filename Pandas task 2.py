# Under the url in file task2.py you will find a data set on academic salaries. Use it so solve the following subtasks:

# Find how many records this data frame has, what are the column names?
# Calculate standard deviation for all numeric columns.
# What are the mean values of the first 50 records in the dataset?
# Calculate basic statistics for the salary column
# Determine the correlation between the numeric values â€“ is there an age effect on salary?
# Calculate the average salary by gender, rank and gender+rank
# Write a function that checks if a professor is up for tenure by checking if the time passed since obtaining the phd is at least 6 years. Apply the function to each row of the DataFrame.
# Write a more realistic function that checks if a professor is up for tenure by checking if rank is assistant and the time passed since obtaining the phd is at least 6 years. Apply the function to each row of the DataFrame.
